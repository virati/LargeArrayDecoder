# LargeArrayDecoder
A project I worked on during my M.S.E. Developed to decode large-array FRET signaling of shared transcript, circa 2011

The goal of this was to take a grid of 'rna decoding' processes with FRET-based signal reflecting specific nucleotides and then decode the RNA sequences from the grid-level signals.
At the time, I knew it had to involve signal processing.
I took several approaches focused on 'cross-correlations' and basic statistical DSP.
Knowing what I know now, I was nowhere even close.
So this is just a fun repo showing a wholly inadequate attempt to tackle a thoroughly impossible (for a M.S. student in 2010) challenge.
I bet it's relatively easy today...

Maybe I'll make a quick simulation of it to then try to 'decode' it...
